## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to position sections and components in the layout in different ways.

### Continued development

I will continue practicing different layouts so that I can get as close as possible to the original layout and make it pixel perfect.
